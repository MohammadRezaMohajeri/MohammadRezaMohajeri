## 📈 Current Projects

### R-centric Bulk-RNA seq Analysis:
- **Expression Quantification**: Specializing in the use of R packages like `DESeq2` and `edgeR` for quantifying RNA levels across samples, emphasizing batch-effect corrections and outlier detection.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Leveraging R tools to conduct intricate differential expression analyses, aiming to identify genes or pathways of potential therapeutic interest or diagnostic value.
- **Functional Enrichment Analysis**: Utilizing R-based bioinformatics packages for GO and KEGG pathway analyses, interpreting the biological functions and networks of differentially expressed genes.

### End-to-End Analytics in RNA-seq with R:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Perfecting techniques in R for the robust normalization, transformation, and cleaning of RNA-seq data to ensure reliable downstream analyses.
- **Data Manipulation**: Employing R's data manipulation capabilities to efficiently reshape, summarize, and pivot complex RNA-seq datasets, thus facilitating easier data interpretation.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations that not only convey essential data but do so elegantly, using R packages such as `ggplot2` and `pheatmap`.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Streamlining the entire RNA-seq analysis process in R, from data import to biological inference, creating reusable R pipelines that enhance productivity and reproducibility.
